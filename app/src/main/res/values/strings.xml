        Jesus trained and equipped men and women and challenged them
                                to help fulfill the Great Commission. Many of them were faithful to
                                do what God had called them to do and that is the reason we know
                                Jesus today. We want to continue that call by building spiritual
                                movements!
    </string>

        <string name="build_spiritual_movement_2">
             A spiritual movement is God working through a team of like-hearted disciples to win, build and send toward the fulfillment of the Great Commission.
    </string>
        <string name="build_spiritual_movement_3">
         Building a movement involves encouraging students to fall in love with Jesus, walk by faith in the the power of the Holy Spirit,
            and become spiritual multipliers at their high schools by sharing their faith and discipling those who respond.
            As a result, God will change lives, campuses and countries for eternity as students multiply their faith for a lifetime.
